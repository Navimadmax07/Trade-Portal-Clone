                    Before considering shipping merchandise internationally, an
                    important question must be answered: At which point are the
                    risks and charges transferred to the buyer?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In 1936, for the first time, the International Chamber of
                    Commerce (ICC), published under the name of Incoterms® 1936
                    (INternational COmmercial TERMS),{" "}
                    <strong>a series of international rules</strong> that
                    answers this question.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In order to adapt these rules into the most recent
                    international trade practices, many amendments have been
                    added to the rules of 1936 accomplishing what today is
                    called "Incoterms® 2020" which has replaced Incoterms® 2010.
                    <p>
                      The main changes made by Incoterms® 2020 to Incoterms®
                      2010 concern the following points:
                    </p>

                      <li>

                    By making references in their contracts, using one of the
                    Incoterms® of the ICC, the buyer and the seller reduce the
                    uncertain risks inherent in all international transactions:
                    commercial practices and different interpretations from one
                    country to the other. They specify their own respective
                    responsibilities and obligations during the process of
                    delivering the merchandise and the mandatory documentation
                    that the vendor must supply. Also the Incoterms®, even if
                    they are optional, they are recognized as standardized
                    clauses which will prevent any litigation by clearly
                    distributing between the buyer and the vendor: obligations,
                    risks, costs. In addition, they{" "}

                  <dd>
                    In order to use Incoterms®, this must be clearly stated in
                    the contract of sale by indicating: the Incoterms® rule
                    chosen, the port, designated place or location, followed by
                    "Incoterms® 2020".
                    <br />
                    Example: CIF Hong Kong Incoterms® 2020
                  </dd>

                  <dt>Choose the appropriate Incoterms® rule</dt>
                  <dd>
                    The choice of the Incoterm® is an integral part of a
                    commercial transaction. It has to be done in function with
                    the organizational capacities of the enterprise, the type of
                    transportation used, the level of service that the
                    enterprise wishes to provide to the client or the resources
                    of its supplier, or it could be in function to the common
                    practices of the market, or the practices used by the
                    competitors, etc.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The Incoterm® selected must also be well-adapted to the type
                    of goods that will be shipped and the type of transportation
                    that will be used.

                  <dd>
                    For an optimal application of Incoterms®, the contract's
                    parties are required to assign a place or a port with
                    maximum exactitude: ex FCA 25 rue Saint Charles, Bordeaux,
                    France, Incoterms® 2020.

                    <br />
                    It must be stressed in this part that for certain Incoterms®
                    such as CPT, CIP, CFR, CIF, the place designated is not the
                    same as the place of delivery: it designates the place of
                    destination paid for. In order to specify the final
                    destination of the goods, it is advised to mention the
                    specific address in order to avoid any ambiguity.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The same applies for the "out of the factory": Is it a
                    factory in France or a factory established abroad by a
                    French company?

                    Some precautions must be taken when using Incoterms®, such
                    as:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        A good knowledge of the meaning of each Incoterm® and
                        its acronym;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The usage of the variants of Incoterms® with exactitude
                        in order to prevent confusions that could result from a
                        misinterpretation (ex: FOB USA).
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    The Incoterms® are standards accepted worldwide. In that
                    capacity, like all standards (industry, quality, pollution),
                    their names do not cause any divergence. Use only the
                    standardized abbreviations. Any other code will be
                    prohibited! As any standard, they are an explicit reference.
                    As the horses DIN or the ISO 9002, the three letters of the
                    Incoterm must be followed by the specific names of the
                    designated places and the mention "Incoterm", see "Incoterm
                    ICC".
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Do not hesitate to consult an international law firm.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Today's tendency in international business is based on the
                    fact that the buyer is released from all logistics concerns.
                    This valorizes the position of the exporter. It is essential
                    to negotiate the terms of the contract for the first
                    shipment and, most of all, in the case of dealing with
                    countries at risk, obtaining a document of credit as a form
                    of payment will be advised.

                    A sale on departure means that the merchandise will be
                    shipped at the risk and hazard of <strong>the buyer</strong>
                    , which means:

                      <li>
                        from the moment that the goods are placed at disposal at

                      <li>
                        from the moment that the goods are handed to the carrier

                    The Incoterms® for a sale on departure assign to the buyer
                    (in a more or less large amount) the costs and the risks
                    linked to the shipping of the merchandise.

                    The two parties are placed in front of three possibilities:
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        <strong>
                          To keep the law of the exporting country
                        </strong>
                        : That would be very often the wish of the seller who
                        would prefer to apply his own law considering that it is
                        the one that he knows well. However, it is not always
                        the best solution. As a matter of fact, some laws, such
                        as the French and Belgian laws, protect much more the
                        buyer;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>
                          To keep the law of the importing country
                        </strong>
                        : This law can be more interesting for the exporter
                        since it is less constraining; however, it is important
                        to know it and master it well because it could be very
                        dangerous to be subject to regulations that are totally
                        or partially unknown;
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        <strong>To keep the law of a third country</strong>:
                        This choice allows neutralizing the legal nationalism.
                        It is often used in commercial interests for
                        compromising or for convenient reasons (in the case
                        where the court of competent jurisdiction belongs to
                        this third country).
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                  <dt>Swiss law</dt>
                  <dd>
                    In this respect, the Swiss law is often recommended because
                    it favors much more the exporter and, most of all, it has
                    the benefit of belonging to a neutral state, which is an
                    advantage for the parties who are conducting commercial
                    trade.
