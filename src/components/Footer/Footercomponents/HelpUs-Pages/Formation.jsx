                The state has a well-built infrastructure that has attracted
                investments in various sectors. The emergence of industrial
                goods among the top export items is an indication of the rise of
                the industrial sector in Madhya Pradesh.

                Although merchandise export from Madhya Pradesh reached US$ 5.32
                billion in FY20, it is still an area where the State has
                significant scope for improvement. While the responsibility for
                promotion of exports has largely been undertaken by the central
                Government so far, it is increasingly felt that the states have
                to play an equally important role in this endeavour. The role of
                the State Government is critical from the point of view of
                boosting production of exportable surplus, providing the
                infrastructural facilities such as land, power, water, roads,
                connectivity, pollution control measures and a conductive
                regulatory environment for production of goods and services. It
                is, therefore, felt that coordinated efforts by the State
                Governments in cooperation with the Central Government are
                necessary for exports promotion.

                Madhya Pradesh has huge potential to double its share in the
                country's total exports in the next five years. It has therefore
                become critical for Madhya Pradesh to contribute effectively to
                increase exports from the current level of 1.6% to 3.0% in next
                5 years. This would propel exports from the State to reach the
                US$ approximately US$ 11 billion by 2025.
